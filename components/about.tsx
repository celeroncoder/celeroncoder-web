          Hey, I&apos;m{" "}
          <span className="text-white font-medium">Khushal Bhardwaj</span> — a
          Full Stack Web Developer based in Jaipur, India. Passionate about
          building web apps with React/NextJS. I&apos;m also an undergrad at VIT
          Bhopal University.

        <p>
          Other than programming, I write blogs. I&apos;ve developed a hobby of
          writing blogs, mostly technical. Although I may not be following it
          that regularly, you might think, but I do love it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed this habit of writing mainly because I was forced to under
          my academic curriculum, so rather than taking it as a burden I quite
          enjoy it. I&apos;ve developed this unique style of writing with
          personality.

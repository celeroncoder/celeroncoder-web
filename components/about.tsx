          Hey, I'm <span className="font-bold">Khushal Bhardwaj</span> a Full
          Stack Web Developer based in Jaipur, India. Passionate about building
          web apps with React/NextJS. I'm also an undergrad at VIT Bhopal
          University.

            Other than programming, I write blogs. I've developed a hobby of
            writing blogs, mostly technical. Although I may not be following it
            that regularly, you might think, but I do love it.
          </p>

            I developed this habit of writing mainly because I was forced to
            under my academic curriculum, so rather than taking it as a burden I
            quite enjoy it. I've developed this unique or I would rather say
            "writing with personality". I know these are big words for literally
            technical blogging, but I feel like writing it ðŸ˜œ.
